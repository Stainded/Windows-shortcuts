# Windows shortcuts


A repository created with the intention of helping all users who use the Windows 10 operating system about each useful program that can be installed on their machines, an easy way to facilitate use, discover functions, and be a useful guide to help each user with problems and solutions to doubts. 

All the links are useful and official, and in addition to making each item available, all the possibilities will be made available to help each user who uses this repository for their means or purpose, to facilitate their task or exercise to achieve their objective within the operating system.

Programs will be made available, such as video editors, video recorders, tools in general, and a small forum within the repository that will help the user to RESOLVE CONNECTION PROBLEMS, INSTABILITY, or any problem with any APPLICATION installed on the operating system, but I make it clear that if you are going to change any registry in the operating system, THE RESPONSIBILITY WILL NOT BE MINE.

The repository will not provide ways to PATCH, CRAFT or bypass the activation and key security systems of any program or application. This is just a repository to serve as a general shortcut for installing programs and files. If you copy this repository, leave the credits, or make a FORK using the key available on this repository page, don't be a skidder. 

The ways of solving problems, simplifying and speeding up your installations will be improved by this repository, we are grateful that you have chosen to use my repository to help you in your development and personal improvement.
