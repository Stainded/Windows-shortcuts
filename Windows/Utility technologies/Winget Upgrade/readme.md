# Windows Package Manager (WinGet)

Windows Package Manager, commonly known as WinGet, is a command line tool and set of services introduced by Microsoft to automate the process of installing and managing software on Windows. Its operation is similar to other package managers available on Linux operating systems, such as apt, yum and pacman.

### Main features:
Command Line: WinGet runs entirely via the command line, providing a fast and efficient workflow for developers and IT professionals.

* Centralized Software Sources: WinGet uses centralized repositories called "sources", where software metadata is listed. This ensures that software is downloaded from reliable sources.

* Silent Installation: Most installations carried out through WinGet are "silent", which means that the software is installed without the need for user interaction.

* Automatic Updates: The WinGet upgrade command allows users to easily upgrade all installed or specific software to the latest version.

* Manifests: Each package in WinGet is defined by a "manifest", a YAML file that describes the software, its source, version and other relevant information.

* Windows integration: WinGet is integrated into the Windows operating system and is optimized to work well with features such as SmartScreen, User Account Control (UAC) and other Windows security components.

Open-Source: The WinGet client is open-source, allowing the community to contribute and improve the project. It is available on GitHub in the Microsoft repository.

### Basic commands:
* Software installation: winget install [package]
* Software Update: winget upgrade [package] or winget upgrade --all to update all programs.
* Listing Installed Software: winget list
* Package search: winget search [term]
Conclusion:
Windows Package Manager is a valuable addition to the Windows ecosystem, providing a fast and reliable way to install and manage software. It is especially useful for system administrators, developers and anyone who wants to automate the configuration and maintenance of their Windows desktop.
